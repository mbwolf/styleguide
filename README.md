## About
This document defines formatting and style rules for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims at improving code quality and consistency throughout all of our projects. All code in any code-base should look like a single person wrote it, no matter how many people contributed. In order to achieve this, the following coding standards must be followed and strictly enforced.

## Motivation
- Currently there are no set standards in the workplace.
- A lot of developers touching same code base resulting in inconsistent code making it difficult to maintain.
- By adopting a specific set of rules will put us in a better position to scale as a company.

## Vision:
- Define a set of rules to help developers maintain a consistent style that is easy to read, write and communicate.
- Separation of implementation and a rule
- Universal Rules that are not dependent on anything 
- Communicate: consistent verbiage throughout the company
